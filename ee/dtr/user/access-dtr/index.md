Docker Trusted Registry allows you to manage your cluster in a visual
way, from your browser.

![](../images/web-based-access-1.png){: .with-border}


DTR secures your cluster by using
[role-based access control](../../access-control/index.md).
From the browser, administrators can:

* Manage cluster configurations,
* Manage the permissions of users, teams, and organizations,
* See all images, networks, volumes, and containers.
* Grant permissions to users for scheduling tasks on specific nodes
  (with the Docker EE Advanced license).

Non-admin users can only see and change the images, networks, volumes, and
containers, and only when they're granted access by an administrator.
